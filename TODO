- factor colorbox stuff in root/index.tt into common function
- write setup/application authorization routines
  - and Twitter/Identi.ca at this point is just going to be username/password. <sigh>
    - alternatively, i distribute the consumer secret with the tarball.
    - apparently other people are doing this:
      <http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/browse_thread/thread/12c792d39674c496>
    - but apparently xAuth is coming to save the day:
      <http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/browse_thread/thread/c2c4963061422f28>
    - applied for xAuth access 20100217; will just use Basic in the meantime...
    - but by my reading of the draft xAuth standard proposal, you
      still need the consumer secret to sign your access_token
      request, so this seems to not really solve _this_
      problem... <sigh> Basic it is.
- add some sort of facebook comment count/display
- figure out how to support additional facebook stream events
