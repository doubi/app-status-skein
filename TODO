- remove the time-based filtering from twitter/identica accounts; go
  back to storing max post ids -- just hide it in the client layer
  (somehow... need to figure out how the state will get passed in)
- post to twitter dev list about pros/cons of including consumer secret
  - write setup/application authorization routines
    - and Twitter/Identi.ca at this point is just going to be username/password. <sigh>
      - alternatively, i distribute the consumer secret with the tarball.
      - apparently other people are doing this:
        <http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/browse_thread/thread/12c792d39674c496>
      - but apparently xAuth is coming to save the day:
        <http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/browse_thread/thread/c2c4963061422f28>
      - applied for xAuth access 20100217; will just use Basic in the meantime...
      - but by my reading of the draft xAuth standard proposal, you
        still need the consumer secret to sign your access_token
        request, so this seems to not really solve _this_
        problem... <sigh> Basic it is.
- add some sort of facebook comment count/display
- figure out how to support additional facebook stream events
- add 140 char countdown JS to post form
- pause button
